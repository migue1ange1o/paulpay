        <small>A non-custodial streamer and viewer donation messaging system for crypto.</small>
        <br>
        <h3><i> How Ferret Works</i></h3>

        <a href="http://www.paul.town/" target="_blank">Sign up for ferret</a> and paste your crypto address into the user panel.
        <br><br>

        <a href="http://www.paul.town/" target="_blank">Generate a special "view-only" monero wallet</a> and upload the wallet.
        <br> <br> All that's left to do is to set up OBS and stream on your platform of choice!
        <br>

        <h3><i>Keep Your Coins</i></h3>
        Due to Ferret's non-custodial design, you have no need to worry about losing your crypto.  
        <br><br>
        Ferret never touches any of your money and simply acts as a terminal for messages.

        <h3><i>Your Streams, Your Business</i></h3>
        Everybody is invited to use ferret. We are agnostic about beliefs or intentions and believe that technology is like a shovel, a tool for anybody to use. 
        <br><br> Shovel companies don't take away your shovel if they don't like the holes you dig, we won't take away your account if you are a person we dislike.
        <br><br>
        What you believe or do is none of our business. 
        <br> <br>
